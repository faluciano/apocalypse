# Prompt

What if all of the apps I commonly use where to be removed forever? Could I recreate them and have a personal version for me to use? Lets see. This project is called project apocalypse.

# Apps
- Spotify
- Netflix
- Youtube
- Instagram
- Google Chrome?

# How?

Well that's the fun part, we'll see. The goal is to build all of these in flutter in order to learn and also easily create versions for multiple platforms and web. Each project will have it's own REAME with details as well.
